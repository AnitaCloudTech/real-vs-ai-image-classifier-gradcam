# real-vs-ai-image-classifier-gradcam
This project focuses on building a deep learning model that can distinguish real human-made images from AI-generated images (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL·E). The goal is to explore image authenticity detection, a rapidly growing problem in computer vision, digital forensics, and AI safety.
